\section{Structure of XML Document.}
An XML document consists of three parts, in the order given:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item XML declaration which specifies that the document is an XML document. It is technically optional, but recommended in most normal cases.
	\item A document type declaration that refers to a DTD (which is optional, but required if you want validation).
	\item A body or document instance (which is required).
\end{enumerate}
