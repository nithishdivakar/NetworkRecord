\program{UDP Messaging}{15-10-2012}
\subsection{Description}
In this chapter we describe a system which allows simple messages to be sent between two clients directly without a need for a central server.
The messages are sent using User Datagram Protocol by constructing Datagram packets containing message and the receiver’s address.
The intention of this chapter is to illustrate usage of UDP protocol.
In the following sections, we have described an implementation of a simple client capable of sending message to another client and capable of receiving messages sent to it using UDP protocol.
\subsection{Algorithm}
\algorithm{UDPSenderReciever}{}{
\textbf{Step 1:}Start the program\\
\textbf{Step 2:}Do Step 3 and 8 in parallel\\
\textbf{Step 3:}Wait until a Datagram Packet arrives at the port in which the program is bound\\
\textbf{Step 4:}Receive the Datagram Packet\\
\textbf{Step 5:}Extract the payload to \emph{message}\\
\textbf{Step 6:}Print \emph{message}\\
\textbf{Step 7:}Goto Step 3\\
\textbf{Step 8:}Read \emph{Receiver’s address} and \emph{message} from user\\
\textbf{Step 9:}If \emph{message} is `bye' Goto Step 13\\
\textbf{Step 10:}Create datagram packet with \emph{Receiver’s address} as address and \emph{message} as Payload\\
\textbf{Step 11:}Sent this datagram Packet\\
\textbf{Step 12:}Goto Step 8\\
\textbf{Step 13:}Stop\\
