\program{HTTP Server}{01-01-2013}
\subsection{Description}
In this Experiment we tried to create a simple HTTP server program in java.
This java program starts running and binds itself to  a predefined port.
From this state onwards it listens to the port for http connection requests from client.
After accepting connection requests it responds to the request but responding with the resource client has requested.
The server only acknowledges request for plain html files or plain text files.
