\chapter{Basic Concepts of Networking}

A computer network, or simply a network, is a collection of computers  interconnected by communication channels that allow sharing of resources and information. Hence a network is a framework in which the connected machines can exchange information. This requirement raises issues like how each machine is individually identified, how the data is exchanged between machine, how the communication is actually conducted etc. Addressing these issues, several networking standards related to addressing schemes, communication protocols, connection paradigms etc. have been developed. Also, based on how a machine acts during its communication gave rise to development of two distinct network models; client server model and peer to peer model.
