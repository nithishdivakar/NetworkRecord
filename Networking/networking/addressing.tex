\section{Addressing}
Every machine connected to the network is uniquely identified by a 4-byte address called Internet Protocol address . This is typically written in dotted quad format like 128.250.25.158 where each byte is an unsigned value between 0 and 255. But a machine in network may be required to provide many services at same time. To distinguish these services, a concept of ports, a logical access point, represented by a 16-bit integer number is used. That means, each service offered by a machine is uniquely identified by a port number.
