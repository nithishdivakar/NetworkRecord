\section{Bridge}
A network bridge is a network device that connects more than one network segment. In the OSI model bridging acts in the first two layers.
There are four types of network-bridging technologies: simple bridging; multiport bridging; learning, or transparent bridging; and source route bridging.
Network bridges work similarly to network switches, but the traffic is managed differently. A bridge will only send traffic from one side to the other if it is going to a destination on the other side. This is different to a layer 1 switch which sends all traffic from either side. Sometimes network bridges are called layer 2 switches.
Since they need to look at the contents of the traffic going into them, they are much more complicated than a hub or repeater
