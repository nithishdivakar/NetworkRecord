\chapter{Networking Hardwares}

Networking hardware or networking equipment typically refers to devices facilitating the use of a computer network. 
Typically, this includes gateways, routers, network bridges, switches, hubs, and repeaters. 
Computer networking devices are also called network equipment, Intermediate Systems (IS) or InterWorking Unit (IWU).
Units which are the last receiver or generate data are called hosts or data terminal equipment.
The most common kind of networking hardware today is copper-based Ethernet adapters, helped largely by its standard inclusion on most modern computer systems.
